# How to Reset Your Microsoft 365 Password

Forgetting your Microsoft 365 password can be frustrating, but getting back into your account doesn’t have to be. With the self-service password reset (SSPR) feature, you can securely **reset or change your password directly from the SSPR portal**. This process uses your registered authentication methods (such as phone, authenticator app, or email) to verify your identity before allowing a reset. By following the steps in this guide, you’ll be able to quickly regain access to your account and keep your information secure.

## Prerequisites

To complete the process of resetting your password via SSPR, the following conditions must be met:

- You must know your **work email address**.
- You must have previously registered at least one authentication method for SSPR.  
  > ⚠️ If you have not set up multifactor authentication (MFA) methods, follow the [User MFA Setup Guide](https://1drv.ms/b/c/b56a02d57dd252af/EdYELcfDYrFChxLMbRxWKzgBqiH4ypTzqJpFwbkJE8ltXw?e=XPegmX)↗ or contact your **IT helpdesk** for assistance.

## Reset Your Password
1. Go to the [SSPR portal](https://aka.ms/sspr)↗.
2. Enter your **work email address** and complete the CAPTCHA.
3. Verify your identity by selecting one of your registered authentication methods:
    - **Text message** (a code is sent to your phone via SMS)
    - **Authenticator app** (such as Microsoft Authenticator)
    - **Email verification** (if enabled by your IT admin)
4. Enter the security code you receive.
5. Create and confirm a **new password** that meets your company’s security requirements:
   - Meets or exceeds a minimum number of characters (typically 8-14)
   - Includes uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Includes at least one number and/or special character

## Important Notes
- When creating a new password, avoid using **common words or personal information** (like your name or birthday).
- Your new password may take **up to 5 minutes** to sync across Microsoft 365 services. 
- If you are signed in on multiple devices (desktop, mobile apps, or web browsers), you may need to re-enter your new password on each device.
